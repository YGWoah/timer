- when user is logged in , get rid of login and sign up — DONE
	- Navigator hides Login/Signup when authenticated; Login/Signup routes redirect to `/app` when signed in. (see: `src/components/Navigator.tsx`, `src/pages/Login.tsx`, `src/pages/Signup.tsx`)

- show the timer in the title — DONE
	- Document title updated live with formatted timer while authenticated (see: `src/App.tsx`, `src/context/TimerContext.tsx`, `src/utils/generators.ts`)

- get user profile , from auth — DONE
	- Navigator displays `user.displayName` and `user.photoURL` if available (see: `src/components/Navigator.tsx`)

- highlight what tab is opened — DONE
	- Navigation links use `NavLink` and active styling to indicate the current tab (see: `src/components/Navigator.tsx`)

Notes:
- UI/UX changes were implemented without removing routes; if you prefer removing the Login/Signup routes entirely when authenticated, I can update `src/App.tsx` to conditionally render routes.
- I also refactored the Focus Session into smaller components and removed modal pop-ups (see multiple `src/components/FocusSession/*`).
